TASK 1 - Simple Profile & Favorite Things Page

📄 Project Overview

This is my first task in the UPSKILL Web Development track. It includes two HTML pages built using only raw HTML5.

- `index.html` – A simple personal profile page that includes:
  - My name
  - A short bio
  - A list of 5 hobbies
  - A favorite website link
  - A profile image

- `my-favorite-things.html` – A second page highlighting:
  - My favorite books
  - Favorite movies
  - Favorite songs  
  - Emphasized items using `<strong>` and `<em>` tags

Each page uses basic HTML tags like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and formatting.

🛠️ Tools 

- HTML5
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)

📁 How to View the Pages

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` or `my-favorite-things.html` in your web browser
